  This program is an ongoing project that will attempt to generate a real-time 3D spectrogram of a selected song on 
  some local directory. Eventually this program will also attempt to allow the user to modify a song by making changes 
  to a spectrogram that is read into the program.

  Besides being something that's really fun to play with, this project also aims to instill a mathematical 
  appreciation for an rudimentary understanding of the complex frequencies that make up the audio signals that we listen 
  to as music.
